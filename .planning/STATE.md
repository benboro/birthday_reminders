## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: Security requirements (SECR-01 through SECR-04) embedded in Phase 1 as foundational constraints, not a separate phase
- [Roadmap]: Groups depend on notification engine being stable first (research recommendation)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- App Group container must be configured in Phase 1 even though widgets ship in Phase 4 (research flag)
