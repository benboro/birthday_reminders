## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: Security requirements (SECR-01 through SECR-04) embedded in Phase 1 as foundational constraints, not a separate phase
- [Roadmap]: Groups depend on notification engine being stable first (research recommendation)
- [01-01]: XcodeGen project.yml instead of hand-written .pbxproj for practical project generation on MacinCloud
- [01-01]: BirthdayCalculator uses private resolvedDate helper to DRY Feb 29 handling
- [01-01]: ContactBridge.upsert wraps fetch in do/catch with error logging
- [01-02]: ContactSyncService treats .limited same as .authorized for import -- CNContactStore only returns user-selected subset
- [01-02]: Indeterminate ProgressView for import -- sub-3-second operation makes determinate bar counterproductive
- [01-02]: @Bindable for syncService in OnboardingFlowView -- simpler than environment injection for single dependency
- [01-03]: In-memory sorting for sectioned birthday list -- @Query cannot sort computed daysUntilBirthday
- [01-03]: Today highlighting with Color.accentColor.opacity(0.1) -- system-aware color for light and dark mode
- [01-03]: CNContactViewController with allowsActions=false, allowsEditing=true -- read-only quick actions but editable for birthday corrections
- [01-03]: Dark mode verification deferred -- simulator toggle issue, app uses system colors throughout

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- ~~App Group container must be configured in Phase 1 even though widgets ship in Phase 4~~ (RESOLVED in 01-01: group.com.birthdayreminders configured in ModelConfiguration)
- ~~Feb 29 birthdays and non-Gregorian calendars need explicit handling during Phase 1 data layer~~ (RESOLVED in 01-01: BirthdayCalculator maps Feb 29 to March 1 in non-leap years; ContactBridge resolves non-Gregorian via calendar conversion)
