## Out of Scope

Explicitly excluded. Documented to prevent scope creep.

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Gift tracking or notes | Keeping it lean — just notifications |
| "Wished happy birthday" check-off | Unnecessary complexity for the core value |
| App Store publishing | Polished for personal use, not distribution |
| Manual birthday entry | App works exclusively with contacts that already have birthdays |
| Greeting cards / message templates | Bloat that competitors add; not aligned with core value |
| Social features | This is a personal reminder tool, not a social app |
| iCloud sync between devices | Local-only by design for simplicity and privacy |
| Third-party analytics or telemetry | Zero network policy for contact data security |
